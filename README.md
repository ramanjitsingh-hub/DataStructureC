# Data Structure In C

This repository contains various data structures implemented in C programming language. These data structures are commonly used in computer science, and their implementation can be useful for learning purposes or for use in personal or professional projects.

Data Structures Included

    Stack
    Queue
    Linked List
    Binary Tree
    Hash Table
Each data structure is implemented as a separate module, with its own header file and implementation file.

## Installation using NPM
```
npm i datastructurec 
```

## Installation using git clone

All data structures are implemented in a single header file data_structures.h.

The header file provides a set of functions for each data structure, such as `createStack()`, `enqueue()`, `insertAtEnd()`, `searchHashTable()`, etc. These functions can be used to create, manipulate and delete instances of each data structure.

1. Clone or download your library from GitHub.
2. Copy the header file and the source file(s) to their project directory.

3. To use the functions, simply include the header file in your C program using:

```
  #include "data_structures.h"

```

4. Compile their code with the source file(s) from your library using their preferred compiler.


For example, to create a stack, you can use:

```
Stack* stack = createStack(10);
```
To add an element to the stack, you can use:

```
push(stack, 42);
```
